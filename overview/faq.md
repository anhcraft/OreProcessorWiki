# FAQ

1. **Only ore materials supported?**&#x20;

Well, actually you can use any kind of block material such as cobblestone, amethyst, or even bedrock

2. **Does it work with plugin X?**&#x20;

The plugin is developed to be compatible with as many plugins as possible. However, not all of them work in a standard way and require integration. If your favourite plugin does not work with OreProcessor, do not hesitate to contact me!

3. **What about the cost of performance?**&#x20;

The plugin is super lightweight as it does not behave like Minecraft's ticking system. I have tested the plugin on a server with thousands of ores processed per second and the plugin is even not in the top 10 in /timings.

4. **Will upgrading to the Premium version require player-data reset?**&#x20;

There is 100% no data loss. The player data format is compatible with both Lite and Premium versions without conversion or reset.

5. **How to use RGB messages?**

You can utilize RGB in chat messages and GUI. The format is \&#aaaaaa for e.g: \&#2dbd6b
