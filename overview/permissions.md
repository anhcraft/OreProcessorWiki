# Permissions

Some important command permissions:

oreprocessor.inspect to use /ore inspect

oreprocessor.stats.server to use /ore stats server

oreprocessor.stats.player to use /ore stats player

Command /ore to open the menu does not require permission

Other command permissions are rarely used so I do not mention them there.\
