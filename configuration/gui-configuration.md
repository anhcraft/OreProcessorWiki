# ðŸ“Œ GUI Configuration

Ore Processor uses a component-based GUI. You define the layout made from characters. Each character defines a specific component.

The component has a type option for the plugin to handle. You can add additional items to the menu with no type.

```
title: "&0Ore Processor | Menu"
layout:
  - "---------"
  - "--XXXXX--"
  - "--XXXXX--"
  - "--XXXXX--"
  - "---------"

    name: "&e"
    material: gray_stained_glass_pane
  "X":

```
