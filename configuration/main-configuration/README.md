## Behaviour settings

drop-on-full-storage: Enable this option to drop items from blocks when the storage is full. Otherwise, the plugin will show a warning to the player and prevent breaking.

enable-mining-stat-on-full-storage: Enable this option to increase mining stat when storage is full. **This should only be enabled if drop-on-full-storage is set to true. Otherwise, the player can increase this stat infinitely.**

disable-offline-processing: Turn off ore processing when the player goes away. Be fine to turn this on since offline processing does not affect performance at all.

## Accessibility settings
